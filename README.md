# Next.js 15 Client-Side Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when upgrading to Next.js 15: runtime errors on the client-side due to undefined variables.  Previous versions might have handled this more silently.

## Problem

The `about.js` file attempts to access a variable (`nonExistentVariable`) that might be undefined.  In Next.js 15, this results in a client-side error, interrupting the user experience. 

## Solution

The solution involves using optional chaining or a nullish coalescing operator to safely access the variable, preventing the runtime error. The updated `about.js` file demonstrates this improved error handling.
